# FakeNews-SmartBot

This Telegram Bot currently has two features. The main feature is to verify if a given news URL is fake/real. The second feature currently implemented is a news suggester which takes in keywords from the user. 

In order to select either option, just type the command `/start` to get the Bot to start. 

The TOKEN has been removed from the Repo for private reasons.

In order to implement the script in your own Telegram Bot, please generate your own TOKEN and insert it there. 

The model is found in the release section.
